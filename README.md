#### Key Points 

- Question: How do male adolescentsâ€™ school environments impact their gender expression (GE) over time and what are the implications of changes in GE on young adult substance use?

- Findings: In this nationally representative prospective cohort study involving 4,882 male participants, changes in GE over time are predicted by adolescent GE in apposition to school averages, with significant associations with downstream adult substance use.

- Meaning: Interventions that impact adolescent group gender norms may be valuable and unexplored pathways to reducing preventable morbidity and mortality related to male substance use.
